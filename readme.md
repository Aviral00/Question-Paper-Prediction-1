# Question Paper Prediction Using Machine Learning

In this project we use the following machine learning algorithms to make predictions based on the Object Oriented Programing Question Paper dataset

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

The dataset was generated by me by analysing all the available question papers in my college records

So far, The Decision Tree Classifier has given us the best results
